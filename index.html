	Hi there! Iâ€™m a passionate front-end developer based in Amsterdam, Netherlands and working at <a href="https://booking.com" target="_blank">Booking.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
	I've got a huge experience in building design systems and tooling around it. Actually I've built them for <a href="https://mail.ru" target="_blank">Mail.ru</a>, <a href="https://superjob.ru" target="_blank">Superjob</a> and keep working on this topic at my current job. On top of that I've helped some start-ups like <a href="https://avionero.com" target="_blank">Avionero</a> build their MVPs.
</p>
<p>
	I believe that learning technologies on a proper level is always a mix of hard work and tons of practice, so I've released <a href="https://frontloops.io" target="_blank">Frontloops.io</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Oh, and here is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/blv-dmitry/" target="_blank">my resume</a> if that's what you came for! Cya :)
