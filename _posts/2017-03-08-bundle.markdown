Couple of months ago I've spent some time on leveling up my design skills and made a concept of Booking.com index page. Finally I have my own place to showcase it!

When I started with my challenged I decided not to jump fully in the design of the whole page itself but to start with separate UI components.
To start from the foundation. 
Personally, for me, foundations are form controls like text inputs, dropdowns or buttons so that was a matter of minutes before started building them.

After they were done I was ready to jump to some page complex elements as I needed to add some guidelines before I get into drawing the whole page.
I ended up making country cards and felt ready to move on.

During the last part of the session a set up some goals:

- The functionality must be the same as the current version of Booking.com main page. 
They are not ones who change the design just to make it look shiny with no real profit, but ones who test every change with A/B testing.
As for me, I tried to focus on working with Sketch instead of making some UI that wouldn't make it live in a real company.

- Booking faces lots of challenges of working with data everyday and when you change your UI by tiny steps it can become messy sometimes. 
Even though A/B testing shows that one of options won - there may be a better looking realization of the feature with same statistics.
I believe that space should be used to make user experience same or at least similar for different pages.
So the second goal was to make the UI recognizable but clean.

After some evenings of working I stopped on this one:
