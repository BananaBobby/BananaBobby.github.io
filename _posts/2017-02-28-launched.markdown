Hey! I've finally launched my personal page and I believe it will help me share my thoughts and experience with others someday.
 
During the last several years I made a bunch of attempts to make this little goal come true. 
I spent lots of time making new versions over and over again.
Some were nice, others got pretty weird by the time they were finished.
Some got closer to production, others didn't make it through the first several days.
But this time I was really focused on finishing the project and had a clear vision on how it should be done.
